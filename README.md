# small-agi
Yet another Auto-GPT, but this time, it's on JS!

## Note

It's a JS version of the `babyagi` repository. But, made it compatible on NodeJS and optimized it.

## Usage

To use this program, you need to have Node.js installed on your computer. Once you have Node.js installed, you can create a new project folder and create a file named .env in the root directory of your project. In the .env file, you need to set the following environment variables:

`OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key

`OPENAI_API_MODEL`: The OpenAI API model to use (optional, defaults to gpt-3.5-turbo)

`OPENAI_TEMPERATURE`: The OpenAI API temperature to use (optional, defaults to 0.0)

`PINECONE_API_KEY`: Your Pinecone API key

`PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT`: The Pinecone environment to use

`TABLE_NAME`: The name of the Pinecone index to create
Once you have set these environment variables, you can install the required libraries by running the following command in your project folder:

```
npm install dotenv axios @pinecone-io/client prompt-sync chalk
```
After installing the required libraries, you can copy and paste the code into a file named index.js in the root directory of your project. Then, you can run the code by running the following command in your project folder:

```
node index.js
```

This will start the program and execute the main function. The program will execute tasks, create new tasks based on the results of previous tasks, and insert the tasks and their embeddings into a Pinecone index.

## How does it workwork

The script accomplishes its goals by use of an endless loop that performs the following operations:

Finds and returns the first task in the list of tasks.
Sends the task to the execution agent, which will finish the task based on the context using OpenAI's API.
The result is improved, and the enhancement is saved in the pinecone.
Makes new tasks and rearranges their priority on the task list based on the goal and the outcome of the preceding job.
The OpenAI Application Programming Interface (API) is accessed through the executeTask() function. In order to accomplish this, two parameters are required: the objective and the task. After that, it will send a request to OpenAI's API, which will subsequently return the outcome of the task. The prompt consists of a description of the objective, the task itself, and the task that the AI system is supposed to perform. After that, a string representation of the result is given back.
OpenAI's Application Programming Interface (API) is used in the taskCreationAgent() function to generate new tasks depending on the purpose of the prior task and the results of that task. The function requires the following four pieces of information as input: the objective, the result of the prior task, the task description, and the current task list. After that, it will send a request to OpenAI's API, which will then return a string-formatted list of newly added jobs. After that, the function will return the newly created tasks in the form of a list of dictionaries, with the task names contained within each dictionary.

In the end, the script makes use of Pinecone to save and retrieve task results in order to provide context. A Pinecone index will be generated by the script based on the name of the table that is provided in the YOUR_TABLE_NAME variable. Following this, Pinecone is used to record the results of the task in the index, along with the name of the task and any other metadata that may be relevant.
